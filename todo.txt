# Today
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

- set up system using mono camera
-- test on 1:100 model
-- test outdoors with 100W beacon

- determine minimum zoom needed to see feature at distance

- get lidar working with ODROID



#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Soon
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

- set up synchronization scheme for all pre-testing

- assemble drone

- test camera calibration on effect of error vs. distance slope

- determine how to calibrate when ground truth is unknown
-- determine internal model of feature based upon known camera location

- test in full x, y, and z

- determine imu, gps, etc. integration

- figure out how to determine error bars of system

- fly indoors to test effect on system



#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Eventually
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

- test outside on West Garage
-- once I have a strong outdoor beacon candidate

- consider automatic landing platform
-- sensing and landing robustly with considerable disturbances
-- land quad without affecting path of carrier vehicle 



#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Accomplished
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

- test beacon outdoors with inline optical filter

- LISTEN TO LUCA'S TALK ABOUT FILTERS
-- presentation not available online

- put new acl repo on ODROID
-- had to 'rm -rf' acl_system and acl_control since they were on the old repo
-- I assume the other folders are on the old repo as well

- read part 107 requirements and look at eahs(?) webpage for MIT's flight requirements
-- Requirements:
--- remote pilot airman certificate with a small UAS rating test at FAA facility
--- registered UAS
--- minimum 3 mi visibility
--- <400 ft altitude
--- must be Class G else need ATC permission

- test beacon outdoors

- build 100W LED beacon

- fix plot_data.py plot axes

- fix noise handling and clean up code

- tested 16W beacon outdoors in direct sunlight
-- works to about 18 m
